# Data Science Project

## Aim
Analyse the Zomato Dataset to get an idea about the factors affecting the
establishment of various types of restaurants at different places in
**Bengaluru**, along with ratings, votes and reviews.

We also made predictive models about various parameters of a restaurant.

We also suggest a user how much revenue he/she can expect to earn by opening a restaurant with the provided restaurant parameters.

## Dataset
We used Zomato dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/himanshupoddar/zomato-bangalore-restaurants). We cleaned this dataset to obtain the final [dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oZR5CVixCDSUVG1rRex-DJxu34bqN7MM).
